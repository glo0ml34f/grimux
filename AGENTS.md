Grimux strives for low-friction, composable hacking rituals. Commands interact through buffers so you can capture text from tmux panes, transform it, feed it to the AI or run it through your shell. The key commands are:

- `!ls`, `!observe`, `!cat`, `!set`, `!run`, `!gen`, `!code`, `!rand`, `!game`, `!edit`, `!save`, `!file`, `!session` and more.
- Output from commands lands in `%@` for further use.
- The whimsical REPL is designed to keep offensive security researchers in flow.
- High scores from `!game` persist in the session.

Primary goals: minimal friction, composable actions, a hint of ritual and hacker mind ergonomics. Have fun and get things done.
